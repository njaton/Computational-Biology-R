UPGMA

The file using the prebuilt UPGMA works as expected.
This program was created to better understand the algorithm used in UPGMA.
The program sorts as it should but will need updating if the user wants to use it on a different matrix size or wants the values outputed in a different way.

UPGMA w/Loop

Hello, This program is very similar to the last UPGMA program that I uploaded. The only difference is that this program is inside of a while loop. This should allow the user to use the program on a much larger matrix. Hopefully, this program inspires you in some way when working on your own UPGMA program!


QuickTTest

This program was created to create a column of p-values that I can move over to excel to reorganize and input into an online database. This program will also count the number of significant values.
